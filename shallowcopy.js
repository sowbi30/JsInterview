// This code demonstrates an example of a shallow copy. In JavaScript,
//  when you use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value of one array to another, 
//  you create a reference to the original array rather than creating a new array with the same values.
//  Both a and b refer to the same underlying array.

// Here's a breakdown of the code:

let a = [12, 101, 15, [12, 5]]; // Array a is initialized with some values, including another nested array.

let b = a; // Array b is assigned the same reference as array a. They both point to the same memory location.

a[1] = 15; // The second element of array a is modified to have the value 15.

a[3][0] = 55; // The first element of the nested array within array a is modified to have the value 55.

console.log(a, b)  //[ 12, 15, 15, [ 55, 5 ] ] [ 12, 15, 15, [ 55, 5 ] ];

// Both arrays a and b are logged to the console.

// As a result, both arrays a and b reflect the changes made because they are referencing the same underlying array.
//  If it were a deep copy, modifying one array wouldn't affect the other.
//  To create a deep copy, you would need to use methods like slice, concat, or a library like Lodash's cloneDeep.
